# MOOC Java Exploration

This repository contains my exercises and projects from the **Object-Oriented Programming with Java** MOOC provided by the University of Helsinki. The course teaches programming fundamentals, algorithms, and object-oriented design through the Java programming language.

## Course Overview

The course is divided into two parts:
- **Java Programming I**: Covers basic programming concepts and object-oriented principles.
- **Java Programming II**: Expands on advanced concepts such as data structures and algorithms.

Each part includes several sections with exercises that are tested using the **Test My Code** system.

## Whatâ€™s Inside?

- **Exercises**: My solutions to the programming exercises provided by the course.
- **Projects**: Larger assignments and projects showcasing the application of concepts learned.
  
## Technologies

- **Java**: All code is written in Java.
- **IntelliJ IDEA**: The recommended IDE for this course, though other IDEs can be used (sometimes I use Eclipse also)
- **Test My Code**: Automatic testing system used to verify solutions.

## Usage

To run the code, clone the repository and open it in an IDE that supports Java. All projects and exercises are located in their respective folders. You can follow the course materials at [University of Helsinki MOOC](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/).

## About

This repository documents my journey learning Java through practical exercises and projects. Feel free to explore the code and provide feedback!
